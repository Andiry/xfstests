# FS QA Test 294
#
# Test readdir on fragmented multi-fsb dir blocks
#
# If the readahead map ends with a partial multi-fsb dir
# block, the loop at the end of xfs_dir2_leaf_readbuf() may
# walk off the end of the mapping array, read garbage,
# corrupt the loop control counter, and never return.
#
# Failure is a hang; KASAN should also catch this.
