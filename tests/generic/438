# FS QA Test 438
#
# This is a regression test for kernel patch
#   "ext4: Fix data corruption for mmap writes"
#
# The problem this test checks for is when too much is zeroed in the tail
# page that gets written out just while the file gets extended and written
# to through mmap.
#
# Based on test program by Michael Zimmer <michael@swarm64.com>
