# FS QA Test No. 030
#
# Run the t_immutable test program for immutable/append-only files
# and directories in an overlayfs upper directory.
#
# This test is similar and was derived from generic/079, but
# the original test is _notrun on overlay mount because FS_IOC_GETFLAGS
# FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctls fail on overlay directory inodes.
